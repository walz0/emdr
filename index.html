    <!--think of a traumatic memory
    visualize the image that represents the worst part of that memory
    hold that image in your mind, are there any negative beliefs you have about yourself right now that go along with that image?
    is there a belief that you would prefer to feel about yourself that would go along with that image?
    as you say that belief to yourself, how true does it feel to you on the deepest level? (scale 1-7)
    as you hold that image in your mind and you say to yourself the negative belief, what feelings come to mind?
    where do you feel that in your body?
    how strong is that feeling from 0-10?
    take that negative image and feelings associated and go with it.
